#+TITLE: Sysman
#+SUBTITLE: A Package for managing my guix channel alongside my guix system with emacs

* Basics
At it's most basic level the package will take the values stored in
~sysman-watched-folders~ releteve to the variable ~sysman-config-folder~
and bulid a ui for interacting with each folder in
~sysman-watched-folders~.
* The UI
- The ui will be built from the values gathered by =ls= which will be
  run with ~default-directory~ set to the value of
  ~sysman-watched-folders~.
  
- Finally we will itterate over ~file-structure-alist~ with a formatting
  function and insert the desired text into the buffer which will then
  be displayed to the user.

- after having it's text property set to ~'source-folder~, which is the
  value of the file/folder's parent directory as an absolute path.
* Todo

* Next
** TODO Implement ~sysman--hide-heading~ and ~sysman--show-heading~.

* Done
** DONE Get folder contents
- The =ls= output will the be itterated over with each line being pushed
  to a list, the value of that list will then be assosiated with a key
  whose value is the ~sysman-watched-folders~ value. The finalised alist
  will be returned by the function.
** DONE Create a functin that will iterate over a given list,
- the first value being the key of the default-directory, if any of
  the next items in the list happen to be a directory it will expand
  subfolders to be a sublist with the first value as the directory
  name and the rest of the values being it's contents, if it's a file
  keep it as is.
